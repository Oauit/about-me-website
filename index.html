    <h1> Aidan Ward </h1>
    <p> My name is Aidan and I am 22 years old. I am currently pursuing a career in software engineering.</p>
    <p> I am extremely excited to start learning through the Flatiron School. My class starts on monday September 19th 2022.</p>
    <p> A little bit about me, I am the oldest of four kids and I am half Korean half caucasian. I had orignially started my educational career as an Kinesiology major. The plan was to be a sports scientist yet that would end up changing along with a lot of the world.
        The Corona virus pandemic changed some of my circumstances and I had to shift focus away from school and into work. I worked as a salesmen for a couple years and then shifted into retail tech support. That's where my passion for computerse and computer science grew. 
        I was also able to meet and get close to people that were in the industry and they were able to advize and motivate me to swith careers paths and go forward with software engineering.
        I chose software engineering out of the many different careers in tech because it would give me the tools to create things that interest me.
